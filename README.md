# QR-decomposition
QR Decomposition &amp; Numerical Stability Analysis

This project implements QR decomposition using:
✅ Classical Gram-Schmidt (CGS)
✅ Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS)
✅ Householder Transform
✅ Back-substitution for solving linear systems

Experiments & Analysis
Tests QR decomposition on random matrices (N = 20) with condition numbers 
κ=1,10,100,1000.
